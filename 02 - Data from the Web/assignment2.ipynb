    "# Assignment 2\n",
    "Perform a similar operation to what described above, this time for Master students. Notice that this data is more tricky, as there are many missing records in the IS-Academia database. Therefore, try to guess how much time a master student spent at EPFL by at least checking the distance in months between `Master semestre 1` and `Master semestre 2`. If the Mineur field is not empty, the student should also appear registered in `Master semestre 3`. Last but not the least, don't forget to check if the student has an entry also in the `Projet Master` tables. Once you can handle well this data, compute the \"average stay at EPFL\" for master students. Now extract all the students with a `Spécialisation` and compute the \"average stay\" per each category of that attribute -- compared to the general average, can you find any specialization for which the difference in average is statistically significant?"
